<h2><u>Gravity Knights Read Me Response</u></h2>
<p>This was an incredibly challenging project. It was definitely good for me though. I learned a lot about collaboration, project management, 
and how to use Git/Github. It was certainly an enriching experience. What I did was a lot of little things here and there. When someone needed help 
I made myself available to meet up and help them. I did the basic server implementation based on Kyle's prototype. This server test has been used as 
the basis for the entire project. (I had help from a good friend, Danny Church. In fact whenever I got stuck and I couldn't figure it out, or 
Kyle couldn't- I'd seek his guidance). I helped with the punching, the collisions, implementing the sprites (very minorly), server up keep, score, 
gravity switching (With much help from my good friend Danny), random color, and the documentation video.</p> 

<p>I split up the group into two different teams. The game team- Kyle and myself, and the website team- Brandon, Colby, and Mariah. Where Mariah 
was the bridge between the two. This ended up working out great so that Kyle and I could focus on the game, Brandon and Colby could focus on the website, 
and Mariah worked on stuff in between. (She worked on punching, score, collisions, and basic physics of the game) I feel like everyone got a good chance
to do their part and work in the project. I might have personally done too much but I sort of assumed this role of project leader. I organized times to meet, 
helped set goals, and helped things get finished. I also added to special knights- a "music" knight and a "zed" knight. These two knights 
represent Professor Musick and my friend Danny for all their help, guidance, and support.</p>
