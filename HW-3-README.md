<h2><u>Homework 3 Read Me Response</u></h2>
<p>This took 3 days to do. I'd say over 20 hours of just tweaking/fixing/etc. I was lucky to have other people test it. Seems to work on
all browsers so that's good! The part that took the longest was getting all the functions done. The hardest part was getting, oddly enough
a text box to appear and have it submit to a variable. I moved my variable so all functions could see it- took 4 hours to finally sort it out. I had to use JavaScript to add it- which is why it took so long to figure out- since I was having it change everything each time.</p>

<p>Once I got the name working it was just a lot of writing. I mean a lot of functions that linked to other functions. I know by convention using numbers isn't the best way but it was easier for me to keep track of. I also added comments above each to specify where it belongs as well so I didn't go crazy. All in all- a fun assignment.</p>
