<h2><u>Homework 1 Read Me Response</u></h2>
<p>I didn't have too much of a bad time with it. A lot of this was a refresher. I decided to hard code the style over using a style sheet
because I wasn't exactly sure how to get that to work. I also didn't want to mess with it. I might transition all my style stuff later. I
already am pretty savvy with HTML but working with GitHub was new for me. It was a different sort of experience than I'm used to. It took 
awhile but once I understood how to work on it/with it- things went fast. The absolute worst part was getting the boxes on my page to do
what I wanted them to do.<p>
<p>The text would often be outside of the box and with a mobile first design- this wasn't ideal. It took some reading and forums to figure
out I had to change width/height to auto or 100% and to make everything in line with the box itself. I really wanted to find an interesting
way to segment the parts off. It was frustrating to get the boxes to behave how I wanted but I'm pleased with the end result. This took about
five and a half hours from start to finish. I had to do a lot of refreshers on HTML and a lot of troubleshooting. I was surprised to find
how many different shades of pink exist without using the "rgb(values)" deal.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time going through backgrounds and colors- trying to find what worked the best. A good hour or two of the work was just
getting resources together and making sure everything was in its proper place. I had a difficult time coloring the "a ref" elements- the links.
It worked on the first link but didn't do the rest. I think having a style sheet would help in this case. There was a lot of refreshing and waiting
for my commits to go through to see if something looked right. The entire project was a test of patience.</p>
